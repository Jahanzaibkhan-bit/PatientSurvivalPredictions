This project found that a patient's age, treatment type, and hospital cost affect their chances of survival. The Random Forest model gave better results than the Decision Tree, with 75% accuracy. It was better at correctly guessing who survived and who didnâ€™t. Patients with more serious conditions and higher costs had lower chances of survival. These results can help doctors find patients who need more attention
